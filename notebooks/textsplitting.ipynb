There was a go ld sticker on th e front cover that read:  Discover\\nthe 20 W orkplace Habits Y ou Need to Br eak . The lead endorsement came\\nfrom Alan Mulally , then CEO of Ford Motor Company , CEO of the Y ear in\\nthe Uni ted States, and one of Marshall’ s superstar coaching clients:\\n“Marshall’ s proven improvement process ROCKS!”\\nIn the book, Ma rshall identified  twenty behaviors that often trip  up high\\nachievers in their quest to make  it to the next level. These are  habits he’ s\\nrepeatedly observed hindering talented people from reaching their full\\npotential, dimin ishing their ability to inspire and lead others, and at times\\neven derailing their careers. The  examples and stories were draw n from the\\nglobal b ase of clients Marshall has developed over many decad es as one of\\nthe world’ s most successful executive coaches.\\nA key insight in  the book was spelled out in the title: the same b ehaviors', metadata={'source': '../app/scenario/How-Women-Rise.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",

Because these behaviors worked in the past, people are\\nreluctant to let go of them. On the contrary , many believe they are\\nsuccessful  because  of these bad habits.\\nAny human, in fact any animal, will tend to replicate behavior that is\\nfollowed by positive reinforcement. The more successful we b ecome, the\\nmore po sitive reinforcement we get. W e can easily fall into the “ superstition\\ntrap,” w hich is: “I behave this way , I am successful—therefor e I must be\\nsuccessful because I behave this way .”\\nW rong!\\nW e are all successful  because of  the fact that we do many things right\\nand  in spite of  th e fact that w e are doing some things that actually work\\nagainst us.\\nMarshall wrote the book for a broad audience—not just leade rs at the\\ntop of their or ganization’ s pyramid or ladder , but those on the middle rungs\\nas well.  What Got Y ou Her e  is basically for anyone whose behavior gets in\\nthe way of where he or she ultimately wants to go.\\nSince publication, Marshall has traveled the world sharing and\\ndeveloping the ideas he put forth  in the book. But in the course of doing so,\\nand espe cially w hile delivering a series of workshops for women based on\\nhis 2 015 best se ller  T riggers , he came to recognize that some of the more\\naggressive and self-centered behaviors he identifies as problematic in  What\\nGot Y ou Her e  ar e less likely t o be stumbling blocks for successful women\\nthan they are for men.\\nFor example, instead of claimin g credit they don’ t deserve, wo men are\\noften reluctant to claim their ow n achievements. Instead of always needing\\nto be right, women are more likely to be hobbled by the desire to please or\\nthe need  to be p erfect. Instead of refusing to express regret, w omen often\\ncan’ t stop apologizing, even for things that are not their fault.\\nEveryone has self-limiting beha viors, for the simple reason that we are\\nall human. But although men and women do sometimes shar e the same\\nundermining habits, they frequently do not. W omen often  face very\\ndif ferent challen ges as they seek  to advance in their careers and operate on\\na bigger  playing  field, so it makes sense that women would  adapt their\\nbehavior in dif ferent ways.

The se personal experiences have made us passiona te about the\\nneed for this book and convinced us of its potential value.\\nMarshall’ s aha came while coaching the legendary leader Frances\\nHesselbein, who had coincidentally been extensively profiled in  Sally’ s best\\nseller ,  The Female Advantage . Frances will be mentioned quite a bit in this\\nbook.\\nDuring her long tenure as CEO of the Girl Scouts of the USA, Frances\\nhad gained international atten tion when no less an expert than Peter\\nDrucker , the founder of modern  management, wrote that she w as possibly\\nthe fines t leader he’d ever met and suggested she be considered  to head up\\nGeneral Motors . Upon retiring from the Girl Scouts, Frances a ssumed the\\npresidency of the Peter F .

She has twenty-three\\nhonorary PhDs,  was profiled on  the cover of  BusinessW eek , and received\\nthe Pres idential Medal of Freedom, the highest honor accorded to American\\ncivilians. Marshall was honore d to accompany her to the White House\\nwhen she accepted this well-deserved recognition from President Clinton.\\nMarshall had first met her when she was still with the Girl Scouts. He\\nwas doing volunteer work for the Red Cross, whose CEO at the time was a\\nmember of Frances’ s board and a mutual friend. When Marshall described\\nto h er the 360-d egree feedback process he had developed to help clients\\nbecome better leaders, Frances decided she could benefit from some\\ncoaching, and Marshall donat ed his time. As part of the process, he\\ninterviewed her board members, direct reports, and other stakeholders and\\nwrote up a full report.\\nNot surprisingly , the feedback for Frances was incredibly positive.\\nHowever , when she saw it, her immediate response was, “I have so many\\nthings I need to improve!” She then began listing about twenty-s even things\\nshe wanted to g et right to work on. While Marshall was impressed by her\\ndedication, he was surprised that a person of her stature was so self-critical.\\nHe knew  that most of the high-performing men he worked with would\\nhave vie wed the  kind of feedba ck Frances received as a testam ent to their', metadata={'source': '../app/scenario/How-Women-Rise.pdf', 'page': 12}),\n",

In the years\\nsince, h e’ s foun d this to be true with other fantastic women leaders. No\\nmatter how ef fective they’ve been or how much recognit ion they’ve\\nreceived, wome n often tend to focus on all the ways they believe they fall\\nshort. As a resu lt, when coaching women, Marshall usually s tarts with a\\nground-rule request:  Please do not be too har d on yourself .\\nSo M arshall’ s aha was that su ccessful women’ s tendency to critique\\nthemselves instead of others opens them to dif ferent behavioral habits than\\nmen, who are more likely to accept recognition and deflect blame.\\nSally’ s aha was more persona l and painful, providing insight into a\\nbehavior that had helped her earlier in her career but was now getting in her\\nway . By  chance, it occurred wh en she and Marshall were co-delivering a\\nhalf-day seminar for female engineers in Rhode Island.\\nSally’ s usual practice before big  events was to spend huge amounts of\\ntime reh earsing her program and memorizing her talking points so she\\ncould deliver her program smoothly and avoid any mistakes. So  she arrived\\nin P rovidence early on the day before the event and stayed in her hotel\\nroom to prepare.

Diligence  and a willingness to work\\nextremely hard had helped her when she was starting out as a speaker , but\\ncontrasting her own dutifulness with Marshall’ s spontaneous and for giving\\napproach made clear that her audience would enjoy themselves more and\\nprobably learn more if she were less driven by her desire to be perfect.\\nMarshall had hardly been perfe ct.

In our experience,\\nwomen often define success a bit dif ferently than men. This means they\\nalso define success dif ferently than or ganizations have traditionally\\nexpected people (primarily men) to define success.\\nInstead o f viewi ng money and p osition as the sole or even chief markers\\nof su ccess, women also tend to  place a high value on the qua lity of their\\nlives at work an d the impact o f their contributions. Enjoying co-workers\\nand clients, having some degre e of control over their time, and believing\\nthat thei r work makes a positive dif ference in the world are key  motivators\\nfor many successful women.\\nThis does not m ean women don’ t care about financial reward or  position\\n— not at all . If women believe they are underpaid or feel their position in\\nthe or ga nization doesn’ t reflect  the level of their contribution, they will\\nresent it. And this will certa inly impact their commitmen t and their\\nperception of success. After al l, money and position are still  the carrots\\ncompanies use to reward people  and recognize their value. And  most of us\\nwork because we need or want money .\\nHowever , one reason or ganizations sometimes struggle to retain high-\\nperforming women is that they operate on the presumption that  high salary\\nand high position will always be suf ficient motivators  even if the quality of\\nwork life is consistently low . Th is assumption, especially when it comes to\\nwomen, is often wrong. In fact , women are more likely to leave jobs that\\nof fer a high sala ry and position but a low quality of life. They often report\\nfinding such jobs “not worth it.”\\nThese are not w ild generalizations.

The results appeared in their book,  The Female V ision:\\nW omen’ s Real Power at W ork.\\nThe survey , which was delivered to 818 men and women who held\\nmanagement pos itions in companies with more than fifty employees, found\\nmany similaritie s between men and women. For example, both men and\\nwomen reported deriving great satisfaction from leading teams, posting\\nresults that exceeded expectations, and being recognized for their\\ncontributions.\\nBut the survey also indicated that men tended to place greater value on\\nattaining a high position and earning a high salary , whereas women placed a\\nhigher value on the actual expe rience of work. Earning an exce llent salary\\nor achieving a top position did not feel as satisfying to women  if they wer e\\nunable to also e njoy their days . Not every day , of course. But enough to\\nmake the job feel worth it.\\nMen not  only tended to view po sition and salary as more impor tant than\\nwomen d o, they  were more likel y to judge themselves (and othe rs) based on\\nthese measures. Sally and Marshall have both seen how this form of\\ncomparing can lead successful men to underinvest in key relationships, such\\nas family , friends, and commu nity , even though these relationships have\\nconsistently bee n shown to be essential components of human happiness\\nand satisfaction.\\nSally and Julie’ s research also found that men placed a greater value\\nthan wo men on winning, viewing it as a significant source of satisfaction\\nand a key mark er of success.

Because if you do, you might lose your advantage.\\nAs a coach, Marshall most often sees resistance to change manifest in\\nthree stages.\\n• In Stage One, the person decides that whoever is suggesting he needs\\nto change must be confused.', metadata={'source': '../app/scenario/How-Women-Rise.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='• In Stage T wo, the person begins to recognize that, while the general\\nsuggestion about change might be valid, the critique does not apply to\\nhim —if it did, why would he be so successful?\\n• In Stage Three, the person simply attacks whoever suggests he needs\\nto change something about himself. He just blames the messenger .\\nThis enables him to continue buying into his own rationales.\\nMarshall has grown accustomed to seeing this pattern. But most leaders\\nand powerful people are men. So the question we need to ask is  whether\\nthis pattern of r esistance is also typical among women .\\nOf cours e, some  women react this way . W omen, as we all know , are not\\nall alike. Neither are men. Gender is only one factor in determining how\\neach of us respo nds to feedback, observations, suggestions, and critiques—\\nto any evidence that we might need to change a behavior .\\nThat said, women often have very dif ferent experiences at work and may\\nevoke dif ferent responses from those they work with. What they say is often\\nheard dif ferently , or not at all—a phenomenon popularly known as\\n“speaking while female.” They may carry more responsibilities, especially\\nat home. They may define success dif ferently , as we have seen.\\nSo it’ s hardly surprising tha t women’ s resistance can surface in\\ndistinctive ways .

Nevertheless, I\\nwas con stantly critiqued by male bosses for having ‘sharp elbow s.’ I always\\nsaw this  as an e xample of unconscious bias.

In this schema, good fortune and\\nother people play minor roles.\\nIn some cases, such beliefs can actually be empowering.

Men are often described as ambitious, of course, but\\nrarely w ith the qualifier  too . It seems primarily to be reserved for ambitious\\nwomen. So it’ s not surprising that even very successful wome n are often\\nreluctant to describe themselves as ambitious.\\nThe psychiatrist  Anna Fels, wh o works with some of New Y ork’ s top\\nwomen in finance and law , noticed this reluctance when researching her\\nwonderful book,  Necessary Dr eams: Ambition in W omen’ s Changing Lives .\\nSo she asked some of her clients  what associations came to mind when they\\nthought about ambitious women.

This habit often proceeds from the\\nassumption that trying to change your behavior would somehow be a\\nbetrayal of the real you.\\nThough an excessive “need to be me” is gender neutral, men and  women\\noften manifest it in dif ferent w ays. Marshall hears senior male executives\\nvehemently defe nding their unwillingness to praise people who work for\\nthem on the gro unds that for th em to do so would be phony . “That’ s not\\nhow I talk,” they  might say . “It wouldn’ t be authentic for me to gush over a\\nsubordinate’ s performance.” W omen caught in the authenticity trap are\\nmore lik ely to say things such a s, “I’m just not the self-promot ional type.”\\nBut if you know a behavior isn’ t working for you, and you persist on doing\\nit anyway , that’ s not being authentic: that’ s just being stubborn.\\nSo whenever you hear yourself proclaiming that something is  just not\\nyou , y ou might wan t to question yo ur motivation. An excessive devotion to\\na pa rticular self-image can be a rationale for remaining stuck.

This is true for two reasons.\\nFirst, without really intending to, people in or ganizations often assign\\none another an identity or a role based on past behavior . For example:\\n• “Marcy would be a good choice for the task force; she’ s always eager\\nto volunteer .”\\n• “Someone other than Sandra should probably handle this job. It calls\\nfor diplomacy and tact, and she’ s always so blunt.”\\n• “Chantal is a great listener—she’d be good in this role.”\\nOf cour se, there’ s nothing wrong with taking people’ s skills and\\ndispositions into account when handing out assignments. But it can have the\\nef fect of  keeping people stuck in  a rut. It shields them from cha llenges that\\ncould be nefit their developmen t, and denies them the chance to practice\\nnew behaviors. And should they try to break free from familiar patterns,\\nthey may stir blowback.\\nSay you’re Marcy and you’ve begun to recognize that your eagerness to\\nvolunteer for extra assignments is rooted in a desire to please  or placate\\nothers, even when doing so d oesn’ t serve your best interests. Y ou’ve\\ndecided to try to be more strategic in evaluating which opportunities to\\npursue and which to let pass. So when someone on your team asks for\\nvolunteers for a project that doesn’ t fit your strategic goals, you force\\nyourself to sit on your hands.\\nY ou ma y feel pleased that y ou’re showing discipline. But then a\\ncolleague expresses surprise tha t you aren’ t signing up. “Y ou’re always so\\nhelpful,” she might say . Or , “What happened? Y ou’re usually f irst in line.”\\nThe implication  is that you’ve stepped out of character and disappointed\\nexpectations by departing from your usual script.\\nWhen this happens, you may fe el pressured to act more “in character .”\\nThe pos itive behavioral changes you’re trying to make have run  up against\\nexpectations tha t keep you trap ped.

The point\\nhere is that people in or ganizations often assign one another roles based on\\nprevious behavi or , which has t he ef fect of making it dif ficult  to practice\\nnew ones.\\nThe second way or ganizations make it hard for people to change is\\nthrough their strong bias for action.\\nAlmost every or ganization is de signed to demonstrate a commitment to\\npositive action, to  doing things . “W e are pursuing new markets in X.” “W e\\nare expanding our of ferings to include Y .” “W e are instituting a new\\naccountability s ystem.” There is rarely any mention of paths not taken,\\nactions not pursued. Even when  deliberate inaction saves the or ganization a\\nbundle, this is rarely discussed for the simple reason that inaction is not\\nseen as a virtue.\\nAnd so at a team retreat, you ma y be told that focusing your attention on\\nnew-customer n eeds must be your top priority . But you will rarely be\\nencouraged to stop checking yo ur phone every few minutes so  you can be\\nmore fully present for what y our customer is saying. The emphasis is\\nalways on what you should do, never on what you should  stop  doing.\\nSimilarly , your company’ s CEO might regularly give motivational “talks\\nto the troops” in which he or she sings the praises of being a good team\\nplayer . But how often do you h ear leadership exhorting top performers to\\nfocus  less  on making their numbers in order to better support the team?\\nBecause of this bias for actio n, or ganizations recognize and reward\\npeople p rimarily for what they d o—bringing in a new client, sig ning a deal,\\nhitting a number . Rarely is someone congratulated, much less rewarded, for\\navoiding a deal that could have gone wrong, even when the r esult would\\nclearly have been catastrophic. I nstead, those who raise warnings about the\\nconsequences of  various actions are often viewed as naysayers,  out of step\\nin a can-do culture.\\nIt may sound paradoxical that th is bias for action could make it hard for\\npeople t o change, since change is usually associated with takin g action. If\\nyou want to get fit, you head for the gym. If you want to rise in the\\nor ganization, yo u put in more hours. But a key insight as you  progress in\\nyour career is that behavioral change is often about  not  a cting rather than\\nacting.

       " Document(page_content='of time teaching  leaders what t o do. W e don’ t spend nearly enough time\\nteaching them what to stop.”\\nMarshall’ s decades of coaching confirm the wisdom of Drucker ’ s\\nremark. He finds that clients who make long lists of “to-do” be haviors ( say\\nplease a nd thank you, be mor e  patient, tr eat others with r espect ) have a\\nmore dif ficult time changing th an those who focus on a few “must-stop”\\nbehaviors ( stop sharing your opinion on everything, quit taking other\\npeople’ s work for granted, don’ t claim cr edit you don’ t deserve ). Even the\\nsimple injunction to “stop being a jerk” is often more ef fective than\\nitemizing desirable behaviors to try out.\\nSally ha s also seen how the bias for action can undermine the a bility of\\npeople to let go of behaviors that no longer serve them. A viv id example\\ncame during a recent client call about a leadership workshop she was\\nscheduled to deliver . After she had sketched out the program, the head of\\nthe planning committee spoke up.\\n“The most important thing is th at your program should be imm ediately\\nactionable,” she  said. “W e have a very proactive culture around  here, so we\\nwant to make su re you give peo ple plenty of to-dos. The ideal would be for\\nparticipants to walk away wit h five new things they can do Monday\\nmorning.”\\nSally ha d heard such requests in the past and tried to accommodate\\nthem. But now she pushed back. She noted that in her experience the last\\nthing most people in or ganizatio ns need is five new things to do  on Monday\\nmorning.

But reluctance\\nto c laim achievements is common among women in every se ctor and at\\nevery level. When delivering workshops to high-potential younger workers\\nand women leaders, Sally often  makes reference to her partner ship survey\\nand asks, “How many of you are good at drawing attention to what you\\nachieve?” Usua lly , only scattered hands go up. Sometimes, not a single\\nwoman describes herself this way .\\nWhen asked to reflect on  why  they struggle with claiming their\\nachievements, answers vary .

Basically it means that\\npeople act the way the group they identify with expects them to act. If you\\nfeel uncomfortable drawing attention to your achievements, it’ s often\\nbecause your referent group— other women, a former boss, a repressive\\nculture, your family of origin—expects you to be modest and self-ef facing.\\nAs a result, y ou tend to view behaviors that don’ t meet these\\nexpectations as disruptive.

Then, with great\\ntrepidation, she let her practice head know she was looking around.\\n“W ould you consider staying if you were made partner?” he asked.\\nW ithout hesitating, Maureen said yes.\\n“Assume it’ s going to happen,” he told her . “Don’ t make any mo ve till it\\ndoes.

Maureen asked\\nwhy he believed the associate would leave if he weren’ t promoted in this\\nround.\\n“That’ s easy ,” he said. “The guy has been talking about making partner\\nsince his first day here. He’ s totally motivated by the desire and expects it to\\nhappen in his first year of eligibility . If we don’ t give it to him now , I\\nguarantee we’ll lose him to the first firm that makes an of fer .”\\n“What about Jill?” Maureen a sked. “W on’ t she expect to b e made\\npartner as well?”\\n“Maybe,” he responded. “But she’ s never said anything about it or\\npushed to be considered. She se ems to enjoy the work for its own sake. I\\nknow she likes our practice group and has strong ties to her clients. So I\\nwouldn’ t expect her to leave if she weren’ t chosen this year .”\\nTher e it is,  thought Maureen.  That’ s the r eason it took me so long to\\nmake partner . I didn’ t start talk ing about it the moment I arrived. It never\\noccurr ed to me to do that. I figur ed if I did outstanding work, I would be\\nchosen when the time came. I assumed that was how things worked.\\nThe next three y ears on the com mittee taught Maureen that this situation\\nwas not  unique —not for her a nd not for Jill, the associate whose name\\ncame up  at that first meeting. “ T ime and again, I heard the same rationale\\nfor p romoting a man earlier th an a woman:  he want s it mor e, he’ s been\\nlobbying for it since he arrived, he’ll never stay if he’ s not chosen .

Says\\nMaureen, “Whe n a woman’ s name came up for consideration, you’d hear\\nthings like, ‘She’ s probably not that interested in making partner now\\nbecause she’ s at the age for having children.’ I’d point out that most of our\\nfemale partners had children, and that they shouldn’ t assume a woman\\nwasn’ t interested in making partner because she was a certain age. It took a\\nwhile, but the c ommittee finally figured out a simple solution.  Which was\\nto ask the woman how  she  saw her future in the firm.”\\nThis shift set in  motion a chain of events that expanded the pool of\\nwomen being considered for partner , which in turn began to slow female\\nattrition. The bottom line, says Maureen, is that “there will always be guys\\nat ou r fi rm who start saying ‘I’m totally awesome’ on the day they arrive.\\nBecause they say it, partners used to assume it was true. Now they’re\\ngetting u sed to the idea that there isn’ t a direct corollary betw een who is\\n‘partner material’ and who just  says  t hey are. But it  took some work to get\\nhere.”\\nAs a result of he r experience, Maureen became passionate abou t letting\\nwomen entering the firm know how important it is to take responsibility for\\ngetting noticed. “I tell them, say what you’re doing, say what you’ve\\naccomplished, a nd say what motivates you.

Peter Drucker , a major influence on\\nboth of us and s omeone we both knew personally , and with who m Marshall\\nworked, was the first to speak about the importance of having such a\\nstatement, both for or ganizations and for individuals.\\nPeter Drucker once told Marshall, “Y ou should be able to p ut your\\nmission statement on a T -shirt.” Marshall believes this small bit of advice\\nchanged his life. Developed years ago, Marshall’ s mission is clear and\\nsimple, to become the world authority on “Helping successful leaders\\nachieve positive, lasting change in behavior .” It worked! T oday , if you do a\\nGoogle search for “helping successful leaders” (in quotes), of t he first 500\\nresults, approximately 450 are about Marshall.\\nA c rystal clear sense of what you’re trying to do and why you are\\nmotivated to do it not only enab les you to speak your truth powerfully and\\nconcisely , it also helps you clari fy which opportunities you want to embrace\\nand which you should let go of. Y ou simply ask yourself,  W ould doing this\\nhelp me r each m y lar ger goal?  I f so, yo u migh t want to say yes. If not, you\\nhave a solid reason for saying no.\\nMiranda in Chapter 2  could have used such a yardstick when a colleague\\ntried to enlist her to do some d rudge work on her law firm’ s recruitment\\ncommittee. If she’d had a cle arer , more articulated sense of what she\\nwanted to achieve, she could have used it to evaluate whether the\\nopportunity served her or not. This would have helped her know what\\nquestions to ask her colleague. And it would have made it ea sier to turn\\ndown the request if it didn’ t fit with her plans for her future.\\nCreating an elevator speech can pay many dividends.

At the age of\\nthirty , Ashley had recently bee n promoted to head her comp any’ s huge\\nbusiness-to-business services group. When asked what was most\\nresponsible for her meteoric rise, she surprised her audience by  saying, “It\\nwas learning to let go of being an expert.”\\nAshley explained: “My bigges t career lesson has been learning that,\\nwhile expertise is  expected  i n almo st any job, it doesn’ t do much to help\\nyou get ahead. I t took me a while to see this. When I joined th e company ,\\nthere were very few women, a nd I worried about being up to the job. I\\ncertainly lacked the confidence of the guys around me.

T ed had watched his\\ncompany evolve  from its earlies t beginnings. He’d seen brilliant engineers\\nchange the world, and he’d seen brilliant engineers crash and burn.\\nIn T ed’ s view , th ose who thrived understood that there are four kinds of\\npower in or ganizations.\\nThe firs t kind of power is the power of expertise, which we’ve been\\ndiscussing. Knowledge companies like Intel (or Ashley’ s and Ana’ s\\nemployers) are entirely reliant on human talent to create, refine, prototype,\\nmanufacture, m arket, sell, and distribute products whose value  lies in the\\nspecialized knowledge vested in their processes and design. Because\\nexpertise is required for succe ss, demonstrating expertise can  become a\\ncompetitive spo rt in such companies. But for the reasons Ana discovered,\\ncultivating expertise at the expense of other kinds of power will not position\\nyou as a leader .\\nThe second kind of power is the power of connections, or the p ower of\\nwhom y ou know . Connections are usually built as you move around in the\\ncompany , hold dif ferent jobs, find allies, and stay in touch. Ge tting to know\\npeople i n your industry or secto r as well as key clients and mo vers in your\\ncommunity is also important. Connections serve as a kind of currency you\\ncan use to get re sources moving  and assure your contributions get noticed.\\nAs A na learned, overvaluing e xpertise can make you reluctant to invest', metadata={'source': '../app/scenario/How-Women-Rise.pdf', 'page': 79}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='time in building  connections. But your relationships compri se an ever -\\ngreater part of your value as you rise.\\nThe thir d kind of power is the power of personal authority or c harisma,\\nwhich is rooted in the confidence you inspire in others. Y ou rarely start your\\ncareer with much personal authority; it builds as your reputation develops\\nover time. Expertise and connections can help establish personal authority ,\\nbut there ’ s alwa ys another element: a strong presence, a distinctive cast of\\nmind, a way of speaking and listening that inspires loyalty and trust, or an\\nunusual degree of gravitas. Personal authority is what sets the most\\nsuccessful leaders apart, whether or not their authority is tied to position.\\nThe fourth kind of power is the power of position, or where you  stand in\\nthe or ganization . Marshall likes to quote Peter Drucker , wh o famously\\nobserved that “the decision is always made by the person with t he power to\\nmake the decision.” In other words, the person who holds positional power\\ngets to make th e key decisions. This reality often infuriates e xperts, who\\nbelieve their insights should count for more when it comes to making\\ndecisions. Perhaps they should, but they rarely do. Positional po wer is most\\nef fective when supported by the power of personal authority . W ithout it,\\nothers may not trust their leader ’ s decisions.\\nT ed Jen kins noted that or ganizations are most healthy when all four\\ntypes of power are in balance. When positional power overrides all else,\\ndecisions tend to get made arb itrarily , with insuf ficient information and\\nwithout much support. T ruly to xic or ganizations tend to view employees\\nwith expertise, connections, or p ersonal authority as threats to the absolute\\nauthority of positional leaders. Jenkins noted that a chief reason Intel had\\nbeen successful at drawing inno vative ideas from people at every level was\\nthe value the company placed on non-positional power .\\nT ed Jen kins’ s template can be helpful if you have a history of\\novervaluing expertise or expecting it to translate into positional power .\\nExpertise, connections, and personal authority are all non-positional kinds\\nof powe r you can nurture and practice throughout your caree r . The more\\nyou develop these complementa ry powers, the more prepared you’ll be to\\nassume positional power .\\nA simpl e defini tion of  power  is “infl uence potential.” If yo u want to\\ninfluence the world in a positive way—as almost all of the wom en we have\\nworked with want to do—you  have to have power .

Leverage brings distinctive rewards.\\nIn th e previous chapter , we loo ked at the dif ference between intrinsic and\\nextrinsic rewards in relation to mastery and recognition. These concepts\\nalso apply to leverage. In friendship and simple colleague relations, the\\nrewards are intrinsic, which mea ns highly personal and subjective. Y ou like\\nhow som eone makes you feel, you enjoy his sense of humor , you’re\\ninspired or comforted after you talk to her .\\nIn levera ged relationships, the rewards are extrinsic, which means they\\nare measurable and concrete. Y ou gain access to a new group of potential\\nclients o r investors. Y ou have an opportunity to enhance your reputation\\nand visib ility or  learn a new skill. In establishing leverage, you r purpose is\\nalways front and center . This doesn’ t mean you don’ t respect or enjoy\\nspending time with the other person. But the intrinsic rewards are a bonus\\ninstead of the point.\\nIN A GOOD CAUSE\\nThe transactiona l, tactical, strategic, and intentional aspects of leverage can\\nbe a stumbling block for women. The high value women place on\\nrelationships often makes them more eager to seek out personal friendships\\nthat of fer intrinsic rewards than to cultivate connections and collect chits for\\nfuture use.

Then suddenly it seriously does not. When\\nyou’re i n char ge of a lot of people, you need to set expectations. If you\\ndon’ t, you’re virtually training the people who work for you to rely on\\nyou.”\\nIlsa note d a number of factors a t work in Nancy’ s dilemma, all of them\\ncommon among  chronic pleasers. First up was Nancy’ s pervasive sense of\\nguilt. Sh e felt self-conscious about going beyond her family’ s e xpectations,\\nand fear ed being seen as “too big for her britches,” a typical c omplaint in\\nher fam ily about anyone who was successful. As a result, Nancy was\\nconstantly trying to prove she didn’ t think she was better than anyone else.\\nThis made it almost impossible for her to say no.\\n“Nancy believed  that if she left any of the people she had worked with\\nbehind, she would be seen as callous and only out for herself ,” says Ilsa.\\n“That kind of ju dgment felt intolerable to her , so she kept trying to meet\\neveryone’ s expe ctations. The problem was, her expanded resp onsibilities\\ndidn’ t leave time or scope to do that.

Framing it this way , and\\nshowing how delegation could be a nurturing behavior , helped Nancy\\nrecognize her constant swooping as a disservice.

Why does Sheila look bor ed out of her mind?\\nAr gyris noted that disciplined left-hand-column awareness can be an\\nef fective aid in communication , making you sensitive to how others are\\nresponding, and enriching the content of what you are trying  to convey .\\nAnd radar can enrich the conten t and accuracy of your right-ha nd column.\\nBut it’ s also easy  to see how a well-developed radar can send yo ur left-hand\\ncolumn out of w hack.

Now , whenever  I find myself wondering why someone in a\\ngroup or meeting seems irritated or distracted, I simply decide he’ s caught\\nup with some personal problem  or is reliving a disaster from his morning\\ncommute.

As a\\ncoach, I ’m very familiar with C hris Ar gyris’ s theories. But when I found\\nmyself i n a stressful situation, I got so hung up trying to read other people’ s\\nreactions that I for got how useful reframing could be.”\\nAnother way to reframe is to acknowledge what’ s in your l eft- hand\\ncolumn and find a way to work it into your right-hand column.\\nHadley , who owns a garden design service, used this approach when the\\nassociation she belongs to decided to honor her as a master in her field.\\nHadley says, “I was very self -conscious about it.

Ask for help from someone you trust, someone you\\nhave a good history with, and someone you know has a positive\\nframe of mind. Since you’ll be asking the person to observe you and\\ngive you feedback about a behavior , you’ll also want to choose\\nsomeone who sees you on a regular basis, either in meetings or as\\npart of a team.\\n2.  Be specific.  Generalized requests won’ t get you the information\\nyou’re seeking. V ague queries such as “do you think I’m doing\\nwell?” will put the person you’re trying to enlist on the spot and\\nleave too much room for subjective response. Instead, say precisely\\nwhat you want her to notice, based on your start-with-one-thing\\ntemplate. This could be apologizing, oversharing, deflecting praise,\\nunderselling your achievements, minimizing body language, of fering\\ntoo much information, or trying to please too much—whatever', metadata={'source': '../app/scenario/How-Women-Rise.pdf', 'page': 164}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='behavior or habit you believe is getting in your way .\\n3.  Be concise.  Show the person you enlist that you value his time by\\nmaking your requests as brief as possible. A void sharing a lot of\\nbackground, providing long introductions, or repeating the same\\nthing in dif ferent ways. And remember that being succinct requires\\nyou to prepare in advance. So know how you’re going to phrase your\\nrequest before you make it, and think through how you can concisely\\nrespond to likely questions.\\n4.  Remember that disclosur e is not the point.  Don’ t belabor  why  you\\nwant to change a habit or share your analysis of the reasons you\\nbehave as you do. It doesn’ t matter all that much to others. Keep in\\nmind that you’re seeking to change a behavior that limits your\\npotential, not rehash the past or sign people up for a therapy session.\\n5.  Specify a time limit.  Don’ t ask for an open-ended commitment.\\nInstead, request the person you engage to observe you at a specific\\nevent or for a bounded period of time, such as during a scheduled\\nmeeting or over the next few weeks.\\nHow you ask for help is important. But it’ s not all that matters. Y ou’ll\\nalso want to be intentional about how you respond to the feedback you\\ninvite. Y ou don’ t want to be reactive or appear upset if you h ear painful\\ntruths, as this will make the person you enlist regret having signed on.\\nIt’ s also  good to have an advance plan for responding, especially as\\nfeedback is notoriously dif ficult to hear . Nobody enjoys being propositioned\\nby a colleague or friend with the dread phrase “May I of fe r you some\\nfeedback?” Y ou might smile, but you’re probably gritting your teeth inside\\nand holding yourself back from  responding,  No, you most certainly may\\nnot .\\nUnsolicited feed back feels like criticism, no matter how “helpf ully” the\\nobservations are phrased, which is why it makes most people defensive. But\\nwhen y ou enlist someone to of fer their thoughts, you’re soliciting the\\nfeedback, so defensiveness is beside the point and self-defeating.\\nY our task is to respond graciously and take what you need.\\nMarshall has developed a coaching template that provides guidance for\\nusing feedback when trying to change behaviors.

It also  requires a\\nmeasure of humility .\\nIt’ s easy to for get in the heat of conversation that listening and speaking\\nare two entirely dif ferent activ ities, which means you can’ t listen at the\\nsame time you speak.

This is true even when you think you’re\\ndoing a good im pression of someone who’ s listening, nodding  your head\\nand saying  uh-huh  in all the right places.\\nBut think about it. As we noted in Chapter 13 , a  small child can tell\\nwhen yo ur thou ghts are elsewhere. So can your dog and your c at.

       " Document(page_content='Feedforward\\nOkay , fine, you get that. But  how  do you let go of self-judgment? Especially\\nif it’ s become a default or reflex?\\nOne useful technique is feedforw ard, which Marshall has used for years\\nwith great success. Y ou’re alrea dy familiar with the basic conc ept, though\\nnot with the name, from t he previous chapter because  the basic\\nask/listen/thank template described there also applies to feedforward.\\nBut what distinguishes feedforward from its familiar cousin feedback,\\nand wha t makes  it so useful for letting go of judgment, is that feedforward\\nis concerned only with the future. W ith feedforward, you’re no t enlisting a\\ntrusted ally to observe you or send signals when you revert to  a behavior\\nyou wan t to leave behind. Instead, you’re simply requesting a few ideas you\\nmight use in the future. No critique or intervention is involved.\\nSay for example you’ve decided to work on distraction.\\nY ou’ve noticed your attention gets scattered whenever there’ s a lot going\\non o r when you sense that people around you have conflictin g agendas.\\nMaybe you’ve also identified distraction as the root of your problem with\\nHabit 6, Putting Y our Job Befor e Y our Career , since being overw helmed by\\ndetails makes it dif ficult for yo u to develop long-term plans. Or you’ve\\nbecome aware that feeling distra cted by what others might think is playing\\ninto you r problem with Habit 8,  The Disease to Please. Or you believe that\\nif you could feel less distracted, you ’d be able to communicate more\\nconcisely , and so make progr ess on Habit 10. The point is, because\\ndistraction can have many cause s and manifestations, it’ s often a good place\\nto start tackling a whole range of more complex behaviors.\\nHaving made your decision, you approach a colleague or a friend and\\nsay something simple like: “I’m  trying to work on becoming less distracted\\nso I can  focus on one thing at a time. Do you have any ideas I could use?\\nAny practices that have worked for you?”\\nPerhaps you’ll hear somethin g like, “Y eah. I often find meetings\\ndistracting becau se there’ s so much going on. So I try to write down exactly\\nwhat I want to learn ahead of time and keep my attention on that.

No “what a great idea,\\nI’m going to try that tomorrow .” And certainly no “that would never work\\nfor me because…” Y ou’re just soliciting ideas.\\nA great thing about feedforward is that you don’ t have to be choosy\\nabout w ho you ask. Y ou’re not requesting that the person observe or\\ncritique you. Y ou’re not enlisting a peer coach or asking to be held to\\naccount for changing a behavior . Because you’re not making yourself\\nparticularly vul nerable or inviting scrutiny , you don’ t need to choose\\nsomeone you deeply trust or who you know has your best intere sts at heart.\\nAfter all, you’re just looking for suggestions.\\nSince inviting feedforward is no big deal, you can feel free to ask a lot\\nof people and get a whole lot of suggestions. That’ s great, th e more the\\nmerrier , becaus e you’re under no obligation to take any of them.\\nMeanwhile, you ’re informing people about what you’re trying  to do, how\\nyou’re trying to change for the better . This makes it more likely  that they’ll\\nnotice you’re improving. So fe edforward can serve as a kind  of positive\\nadvertising.\\nA final advantage of feedforward is that it’ s a lot less fraught than\\nfeedback. It doesn’ t feel person al like feedback does. As noted , most of us\\nshrink in dread when someone says, “Can I of fer you some feedback?” W e\\nmentally arm to defend ourselves from an attack.

       "'environment, which is why most or ganizations are so eager to tell you that\\nthey embrace and thrive on change.\\nNevertheless, the cruel irony is that despite positioning themselves as\\nchange agents, or ganizations ro utinely if inadvertently make it dif ficult for\\nthe people  within  them to change. This is true for two reasons.\\nFirst, without really intending to, people in or ganizations often assign\\none another an identity or a role based on past behavior . For example:\\n• “Marcy would be a good choice for the task force; she’ s always eager\\nto volunteer .”\\n• “Someone other than Sandra should probably handle this job. It calls\\nfor diplomacy and tact, and she’ s always so blunt.”\\n• “Chantal is a great listener—she’d be good in this role.”\\nOf cour se, there’ s nothing wrong with taking people’ s skills and\\ndispositions into account when handing out assignments. But it can have the\\nef fect of  keeping people stuck in  a rut. It shields them from cha llenges that\\ncould be nefit their developmen t, and denies them the chance to practice\\nnew behaviors. And should they try to break free from familiar patterns,\\nthey may stir blowback.\\nSay you’re Marcy and you’ve begun to recognize that your eagerness to\\nvolunteer for extra assignments is rooted in a desire to please  or placate\\nothers, even when doing so d oesn’ t serve your best interests. Y ou’ve\\ndecided to try to be more strategic in evaluating which opportunities to\\npursue and which to let pass. So when someone on your team asks for\\nvolunteers for a project that doesn’ t fit your strategic goals, you force\\nyourself to sit on your hands.\\nY ou ma y feel pleased that y ou’re showing discipline. But then a\\ncolleague expresses surprise tha t you aren’ t signing up. “Y ou’re always so\\nhelpful,” she might say . Or , “What happened? Y ou’re usually f irst in line.”\\nThe implication  is that you’ve stepped out of character and disappointed\\nexpectations by departing from your usual script.\\nWhen this happens, you may fe el pressured to act more “in character .”\\nThe pos itive behavioral changes you’re trying to make have run  up against\\nexpectations tha t keep you trap ped.

       "'tell the person who pushes back that you’re working on a ne w behavior .\\nY ou’ll find plenty of suggestion s for how to do this in Part III . The point\\nhere is that people in or ganizations often assign one another roles based on\\nprevious behavi or , which has t he ef fect of making it dif ficult  to practice\\nnew ones.\\nThe second way or ganizations make it hard for people to change is\\nthrough their strong bias for action.\\nAlmost every or ganization is de signed to demonstrate a commitment to\\npositive action, to  doing things . “W e are pursuing new markets in X.” “W e\\nare expanding our of ferings to include Y .” “W e are instituting a new\\naccountability s ystem.” There is rarely any mention of paths not taken,\\nactions not pursued. Even when  deliberate inaction saves the or ganization a\\nbundle, this is rarely discussed for the simple reason that inaction is not\\nseen as a virtue.\\nAnd so at a team retreat, you ma y be told that focusing your attention on\\nnew-customer n eeds must be your top priority . But you will rarely be\\nencouraged to stop checking yo ur phone every few minutes so  you can be\\nmore fully present for what y our customer is saying. The emphasis is\\nalways on what you should do, never on what you should  stop  doing.\\nSimilarly , your company’ s CEO might regularly give motivational “talks\\nto the troops” in which he or she sings the praises of being a good team\\nplayer . But how often do you h ear leadership exhorting top performers to\\nfocus  less  on making their numbers in order to better support the team?\\nBecause of this bias for actio n, or ganizations recognize and reward\\npeople p rimarily for what they d o—bringing in a new client, sig ning a deal,\\nhitting a number . Rarely is someone congratulated, much less rewarded, for\\navoiding a deal that could have gone wrong, even when the r esult would\\nclearly have been catastrophic. I nstead, those who raise warnings about the\\nconsequences of  various actions are often viewed as naysayers,  out of step\\nin a can-do culture.\\nIt may sound paradoxical that th is bias for action could make it hard for\\npeople t o change, since change is usually associated with takin g action. If\\nyou want to get fit, you head for the gym. If you want to rise in the\\nor ganization, yo u put in more hours. But a key insight as you  progress in\\nyour career is that behavioral change is often about  not  a cting rather than\\nacting.

       " ' m\\nI n 2 015, a mutual friend and colleague, Mike Dulworth, sent the  two of us\\n—Sally and Marshall—an e-ma il with the subject line “Crazy Idea!” His\\nsuggestion? That we collaborate on the book you now hold in your hands.\\nW e both immediately knew it was a great idea. Explaining why requires\\na bit of background.\\nIn 2007, Marshall published his  international best seller ,  What Got Y ou\\nHer e W on’ t Get Y ou Ther e:  How Successful  People Become Even Mor e\\nSuccessful . There was a go ld sticker on th e front cover that read:  Discover\\nthe 20 W orkplace Habits Y ou Need to Br eak . The lead endorsement came\\nfrom Alan Mulally , then CEO of Ford Motor Company , CEO of the Y ear in\\nthe Uni ted States, and one of Marshall’ s superstar coaching clients:\\n“Marshall’ s proven improvement process ROCKS!”\\nIn the book, Ma rshall identified  twenty behaviors that often trip  up high\\nachievers in their quest to make  it to the next level. These are  habits he’ s\\nrepeatedly observed hindering talented people from reaching their full\\npotential, dimin ishing their ability to inspire and lead others, and at times\\neven derailing their careers. The  examples and stories were draw n from the\\nglobal b ase of clients Marshall has developed over many decad es as one of\\nthe world’ s most successful executive coaches.\\nA key insight in  the book was spelled out in the title: the same b ehaviorsthat help  people  achieve high p ositions often undermine them as they seek\\nto m ove further up. Because these behaviors worked in the past, people are\\nreluctant to let go of them. On the contrary , many believe they are\\nsuccessful  because  of these bad habits.\\nAny human, in fact any animal, will tend to replicate behavior that is\\nfollowed by positive reinforcement. The more successful we b ecome, the\\nmore po sitive reinforcement we get. W e can easily fall into the “ superstition\\ntrap,” w hich is: “I behave this way , I am successful—there',\n",

On the contrary , many believe they are\\nsuccessful  because  of these bad habits.\\nAny human, in fact any animal, will tend to replicate behavior that is\\nfollowed by positive reinforcement. The more successful we b ecome, the\\nmore po sitive reinforcement we get. W e can easily fall into the “ superstition\\ntrap,” w hich is: “I behave this way , I am successful—therefor e I must be\\nsuccessful because I behave this way .”\\nW rong!\\nW e are all successful  because of  the fact that we do many things right\\nand  in spite of  th e fact that w e are doing some things that actually work\\nagainst us.\\nMarshall wrote the book for a broad audience—not just leade rs at the\\ntop of their or ganization’ s pyramid or ladder , but those on the middle rungs\\nas well.  What Got Y ou Her e  is basically for anyone whose behavior gets in\\nthe way of where he or she ultimately wants to go.\\nSince publication, Marshall has traveled the world sharing and\\ndeveloping the ideas he put forth  in the book. But in the course of doing so,\\nand espe cially w hile delivering a series of workshops for women based on\\nhis 2 015 best se ller  T riggers , he came to recognize that some of the more\\naggressive and self-centered behaviors he identifies as problematic in  What\\nGot Y ou Her e  ar e less likely t o be stumbling blocks for successful women\\nthan they are for men.\\nFor example, instead of claimin g credit they don’ t deserve, wo men are\\noften reluctant to claim their ow n achievements. Instead of always needing\\nto be right, women are more likely to be hobbled by the desire to please or\\nthe need  to be p erfect. Instead of refusing to express regret, w omen often\\ncan’ t stop apologizing, even for things that are not their fault.\\nEveryone has self-limiting beha viors, for the simple reason that we are\\nall human.

       " ' to please or\\nthe need  to be p erfect. Instead of refusing to express regret, w omen often\\ncan’ t stop apologizing, even for things that are not their fault.\\nEveryone has self-limiting beha viors, for the simple reason that we are\\nall human. But although men and women do sometimes shar e the same\\nundermining habits, they frequently do not. W omen often  face very\\ndif ferent challen ges as they seek  to advance in their careers and operate on\\na bigger  playing  field, so it makes sense that women would  adapt their\\nbehavior in dif ferent ways. And women are often rewarded dif ferently , as\\nwe will show in  the next chapter . These dif ferences shape their e xpectationsof what behaviors will be ef fective.\\nGiven th at Marshall’ s coaching base is typically about 80 percent male,\\nit’ s not surprising that the original habits in  What Got Y ou Her e  would be\\nthose that most o ften hold back high-performing men. Marshall  didn’ t view\\nthese behaviors as particularly male when he wrote the book, but rather as\\ncommon forms of self-sabotage  that could be corrected using the insights\\nand practices he’d developed a s a coach. Y et the more he w orked with\\nwomen, the more Marshall saw that they could benefit from  a similar\\napproach that addressed dif ferent behaviors.\\nEnter Sally .\\nSally has been working with, writing about, and researching women\\nleaders since the publication of  The Fem ale Advantage: W omen ’ s W ays of\\nLeadership  in 1990. Because it was the first book to focus on what women\\nhad to contribute to or ganizations rather than how they neede d to change\\nand adapt, companies began as king her to develop and deliv er women’ s\\nleadership programs almost from the start.\\nAs a result, Sally has spent nearly three decades helping remarkable\\nwomen around the world grow their leadership skills and consulting with\\nexecutive teams seeking to retain talented women. She has worked with\\nsome of the mos t successful women leaders in the world. This h as given her\\nboth up-close exposure to the challenges women face as well']"
