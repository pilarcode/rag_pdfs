This can make you appear\\ndisor ganized or a bit clueless.\\nOnce yo u identi fy the cluster o f habits that’ s getting in your way , you\\ncan choose the one you want to tackle first. Y ou’ll find suggesti ons on how\\nto overcome counterproductive behaviors in the next two chapters. But first,\\nyou’ll need to figure out  wher e  to start.\\nBREAKING IT DOWN\\nA great way to start is by break ing down a problem behavior into discrete,\\nspecific habits that can be addr essed one at a time. Say  for example you\\nrecognize yourself in the description of Habit  8, The Disease to Please.

Maybe they’re habits you’ve grown\\nattached to because they helped  you in the past. It’ s humbling t o admit that\\nwhat used to wo rk for you has stopped working, and a little sc ary because\\nfamiliar behaviors can feel like part of who you are. But it’ s inspiring to\\nconsider how much you might benefit from letting them go.\\nHere’ s t he tough part: making sustainable and lasting change requires\\nfocus. Not just momentary “Let’ s do it” enthusiasm, but the willingness to\\nmake a consistent ef fort over time. This is best achieved by identifying one\\nbehavior , or even one  part  of one b ehavior , and working o n it until you can\\nsee som e progress. That’ s because making small changes, and repeating\\nthem un til they become habitual, is more likely to yield long-term results\\nthan trying to become a brand-new you all at once.', metadata={'pagina': 155, 'fichero': 'How-Women-Rise.pdf'}),\n",
